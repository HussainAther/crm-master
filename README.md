# Customer relationship management (CRM) Master

In this assignment, you will have the opportunity to develop a new website for a fictional CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system. The design for the website is provided within the project files. This will be a collaborative project where every team member will have an equal role in creating the final product.

Initially, one team member (referred to as the "Original Team Member") will be responsible for setting up the starter files on their GitHub profile. Afterward, each team member will fork and clone the repository to their own GitHub account and start working on their assigned tasks. Once you have completed your portion of the project, make sure to commit your changes to GitHub and submit a pull request to the repository of the Original Team Member. Finally, remember to submit the GitHub link of the Original Team Member to the designated location in Google Classroom.
